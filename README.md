# foodTruck

This was a practice assignment I remembered from week two of the web fundamentals intro.

The Problem:
Food truck worker wants to place his food truck at an optimal location within the town, so that his customers in houses (in my program labeled h1, h2, h3, etc.) have the shortest *total* travel distance.

The Goal:
Write a program that identifies the houses coordinates and place the food truck in the most optimal spot.

Notes:
The town is a grid, with blocks that are all one unit long.
There are four houses per block, one on each corner.
Houses are identified by which crossroad (the coordinates) they reside on, no matter which corner of the crossroad it is.
The food truck will also be placed on a crossroad.
